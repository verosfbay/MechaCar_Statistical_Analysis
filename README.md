# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
In the total summary, the variance is less than the 100 pounds requirement. In the lot summary, lot 1 and 2 meet the requirement while lot 3 does not.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.
For the t-test, the p-value is not less than the significance level of 0.05, therefore the sample mean is not statistically different from the population mean of 1500 PSI. We will not reject the null hypothesis. However, the p-value of Lot 3 is statistically different from the population mean so we will reject the null hypothesis.

Using your knowledge of R, design a statistical study to compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers.

In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
